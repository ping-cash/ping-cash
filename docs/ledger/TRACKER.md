# TRACKER Ledger — Open Work + DoD Progress

**WHAT:** Live snapshot of in-flight work, blockers, and DoD progress. The founder's single-pane-of-glass view.

**AUTHORITY:** 🟢 LIVE STATE. Updated on every status change; cron-refreshed alongside [TRUST.md](TRUST.md).

**Last refreshed:** 2026-05-24 — 14/15 ping ns pods Running; 2 fresh 5-stage walks PASS on live prov: GCash (PING-BE48EAE9) + Maya (PING-6F7AA69D). Bridge+reconciler suite shipped (#40-#48); CLAUDE.md heavy-compute ban locked (commit 61def12) after self-inflicted solana-test-validator OOM outage (recovered without Contabo hard-reboot). 46 labeled `status/completed` (#55, #57 closed; #56 ready) + 2 in-progress (#52, #53 — JWT verify wire); #36 transfer readinessProbe still awaits fresh CI image; 3 founder-business gates (Cayman + audit + KYC KYB).

## BACKLOG-STANDARDS.md audit — 2026-05-24

Per [dynolabs-io/workflow BACKLOG-STANDARDS.md](https://github.com/dynolabs-io/workflow/blob/main/docs/BACKLOG-STANDARDS.md). Triage decision tree applied to every open issue:

- **Action A (fix in place):** 7 issues — #1 EPIC, #22 EPIC, #7 EPIC, #15, #16, #23, #24, #36, #50 (reformatted title + 4-section body + correct labels)
- **Action B (close + re-file):** 0 — every open issue had clear intent
- **Action C (close as not-planned):** 0 — none obsolete

Issues left untouched (status/completed, awaiting founder close): #2-#6, #8-#14, #17-#21, #25-#35, #37, #39 — these conformed to per-Wave discipline at filing time; will reformat lazily IF re-opened.

Status counts post-audit: 1 in-progress (#36), 6 blocked-ext (#7, #15, #16, #23, #24, #50), 21 completed, 2 unclaimed EPIC parents (#1, #22).

## Current Sprint Focus

Phase 1 MVP — Philippines corridor. Goal: ship one end-to-end transfer (GCC sender → PH recipient → GCash cash-out) by Month 6.

## Real-cred plug-in (not blockers — stub-mode live)

The platform is fully walkable TODAY on stub-mode adapters. None of the rows below block the end-user DoD: walks #1 (GCash) + #2 (Maya) both passed end-to-end without these. Real creds are hot-swap via OpenBao env injection — code unchanged.

| Real cred              | Current state                     | Hot-swap path                                      |

## Updating This Ledger

- After every issue status change: update the count + active items table
- After every shipped PR: add a "Recently Shipped" row
- After every external-blocker resolution: remove from Blockers table
- After every walk: update Pillar DoD Progress + cross-reference [TRUST.md](TRUST.md)
- **Commit every change** — staleness IS the bug
