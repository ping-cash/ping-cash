## What's Next (autonomous build sequence)

Per founder direction (2026-05-23) — full autonomous mode, definition of done = usable end product:

1. ✅ Documentation complete
2. **GitHub: File umbrella issue + per-service issues** (TaskList items #40, #41)
3. **Code: Rebuild CI matrix workflow** (#42)
4. **Code: Build auth-service (foundation)** (#43)
5. Code: Build user-service + KYC integration
6. Code: Build wallet-service + Earn Vault smart contract
7. Code: Build transfer-service + claim-service + offramp-service
8. Code: Build mobile app (React Native flows from wireframes)
9. Code: Build web claim flow (Next.js)
10. Deploy: Blueprint to openova-private; Flux reconciles
11. Walk: operator validates each pillar on fresh prov + screenshot
12. Continue until end-product DoD met
