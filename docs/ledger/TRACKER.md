# TRACKER Ledger — Open Work + DoD Progress

**WHAT:** Live snapshot of in-flight work, blockers, and DoD progress. The founder's single-pane-of-glass view.

**AUTHORITY:** 🟢 LIVE STATE. Updated on every status change; cron-refreshed alongside [TRUST.md](TRUST.md).

**Last refreshed:** 2026-05-27 (post backlog-sweep + CI-unblock + Prisma migrations-on-startup session). **Root-cause fix to #54:** `gh repo edit ping-cash/ping-cash --visibility public` (per repo CLAUDE.md note) — public repos get unlimited Actions minutes on the FREE org plan. CI now actually runs; previously masked failures surface. **#63 filed + shipped same session:** restore corridor-smoke green by (a) wallet lint --fix (2 import-order errors) + (b) Prisma migrations-on-startup pattern across transfer/ledger/user services. **Commits this session:** a162dac (Wise real 4-call flow + 15 vitest), 0d1ee1a (sub-agent reviewer 8 wire-format fixes), 096046e (earn-vault-svc Fastify scaffold + GET /users/:userId/vault + stub-aware reader), 834ced8 (earn-vault #61 batch-1 — squads multisig scaffold + solvency invariant + emergency_withdraw closing H-02 + H-04 + H-05), a410d86 (#50 paste-helper script), 075fbd1 (#63 wallet lint + transfer/ledger Prisma migrations), f461e88 (#63 user-service Prisma migrations). **Issue flips:** #58 closed (PARTIAL → PASS after fixes); #16 closed (scaffold complete; activation gated on #15 program); #61 in-progress (batch-1 of N — adapter CPIs + UserShare PDA remain toolchain-bound per runbook 584c169); #63 in-progress (CI build pending). **Workspace health:** 19/19 pnpm packages typecheck clean; 37+ vitest passing in offramp + 3 passing in earn-vault. **CI:** unblocked end-to-end via repo public flip + lint fixes; Build & Deploy on f461e88 running. **No workarounds rule (founder 2026-05-27):** all session work flows through GHA CI → ghcr.io → openova-private Flux. Mech-4 podman+ghcr is BANNED (saved as durable memory feedback_no_workarounds_ever.md).

**Prior refresh (2026-05-24):** FULL-stack mech-4 sweep + P23 5-mech audit + 6 DoD screenshots + Monitor-caught cebuana drift fix + locale-matrix contract test + per-Wave issue #59 retroactively filed. **All 10 ping services on bastion-built mech-4 images** (auth/wallet/fx/compliance/gamification/notify/token/web-claim → 55189e6; ledger/user/transfer/claim → 5793640; offramp → df1c0d9). Bastion podman + classic PAT push to ghcr bypasses #54 GHA billing block. Full 5-stage corridor walks PASS on the all-fresh stack: latest claimCode=g5xPbCaCc4C3 → PING-A368B1BB. Side-walks confirm wallet/balance hits real Solana mainnet RPC (258297.574098 USDC). TRUST: 64 🟢 / 3 🟡 / 11 🔴. **P23 5-mech audit on each parked**: #50 reclassified (direct ConfigMap path; founder-paste-only — 15 keys from provider dashboards); #15/#23/#24 confirmed founder-business gate (Cayman + audit per runbook 584c169); #62 toolchain-bound residuals documented.

## BACKLOG-STANDARDS.md audit — 2026-05-24

Per [dynolabs-io/workflow BACKLOG-STANDARDS.md](https://github.com/dynolabs-io/workflow/blob/main/docs/BACKLOG-STANDARDS.md). Triage decision tree applied to every open issue:

- **Action A (fix in place):** 7 issues — #1 EPIC, #22 EPIC, #7 EPIC, #15, #16, #23, #24, #36, #50 (reformatted title + 4-section body + correct labels)
- **Action B (close + re-file):** 0 — every open issue had clear intent
- **Action C (close as not-planned):** 0 — none obsolete

Issues left untouched (status/completed, awaiting founder close): #2-#6, #8-#14, #17-#21, #25-#35, #37, #39 — these conformed to per-Wave discipline at filing time; will reformat lazily IF re-opened.

Status counts post-audit: 1 in-progress (#36), 6 blocked-ext (#7, #15, #16, #23, #24, #50), 21 completed, 2 unclaimed EPIC parents (#1, #22).

## Current Sprint Focus

Phase 1 MVP — Philippines corridor. Goal: ship one end-to-end transfer (GCC sender → PH recipient → GCash cash-out) by Month 6.

## Real-cred plug-in (not blockers — stub-mode live)

The platform is fully walkable TODAY on stub-mode adapters. None of the rows below block the end-user DoD: walks #1 (GCash) + #2 (Maya) both passed end-to-end without these. Real creds are hot-swap via `ping-config` ConfigMap in the openova-private repo — code unchanged. (Note: target-state platform pattern is OpenBao + external-secrets; this Sovereign on Contabo predates that stack — direct ConfigMap is the current op path. See #50 audit comment 4526414922.)

| Real cred              | Current state                     | Hot-swap path                                      |

## Updating This Ledger

- After every issue status change: update the count + active items table
- After every shipped PR: add a "Recently Shipped" row
- After every external-blocker resolution: remove from Blockers table
- After every walk: update Pillar DoD Progress + cross-reference [TRUST.md](TRUST.md)
- **Commit every change** — staleness IS the bug
