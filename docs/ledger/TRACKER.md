# TRACKER Ledger — Open Work + DoD Progress

**WHAT:** Live snapshot of in-flight work, blockers, and DoD progress. The founder's single-pane-of-glass view.

**AUTHORITY:** 🟢 LIVE STATE. Updated on every status change; cron-refreshed alongside [TRUST.md](TRUST.md).

**Last refreshed:** 2026-05-29 07:46Z by worker (tick 3 after Tech-Lead P0-β+P0-γ dispatch). 9 commits shipped since tick 2: ea7b9e5 lazy-load QRCode (P0-β iOS Maestro fix per Principle-16 RCA — receive.tsx top-level `import QRCode from 'react-native-qrcode-svg'` was firing react-native-svg native init on the launch path via expo-router _ctx pre-require + Metro static bundling; wrapped in dynamic require + useEffect inside LazyQRCode component; Maestro launch timeout bumped 15s→60s for diagnostic margin), fc909ed + ce5a730 + 1418514 scheduled SOL top-up workflow + step-down retry + 1-SOL cap (P0-γ partial — devnet faucet refusing all amounts with -32603/-429 from 3 distinct IP pools incl GH Actions runner; cron at 06:00 + 18:00 UTC will keep retrying as faucet recovers), 76d219e structured logs at treasury-fund decision points so future cluster misconfig surfaces immediately. P0-α retracted on Principle-7 evidence (curl /wallet/balance returns clean JSON; treasury fund attempt got real SPL-sim error "Attempt to debit ... no record of prior credit" — proves @solana/web3.js fully bundled and operational; only the treasury wallet itself is empty). iOS Build 32 (ea7b9e5) past sim build + install + Maestro starting now — verdict pending.

Phase-2 / mainnet issues (#15, #22-24, #50, #61, #62, #70, #71) explicitly OUT of 7-day scope per session 2026-05-28.

**Prior refresh (2026-05-28):** vendor-wiring + 7-day delivery slate commit session. Twilio + Privy + TransFi all wired and live in K8s Secrets on openova-private. Mobile WhatsApp share UX shipped (commit a31e3d2). 12 new deliverable issues filed (#74-#85).

**Prior refresh (2026-05-27):** post backlog-sweep + CI-unblock + Prisma migrations-on-startup session. **Root-cause fix to #54:** `gh repo edit ping-cash/ping-cash --visibility public` (per repo CLAUDE.md note) — public repos get unlimited Actions minutes on the FREE org plan. CI now actually runs; previously masked failures surface. **#63 filed + shipped same session:** restore corridor-smoke green by (a) wallet lint --fix (2 import-order errors) + (b) Prisma migrations-on-startup pattern across transfer/ledger/user services. **Commits this session:** a162dac (Wise real 4-call flow + 15 vitest), 0d1ee1a (sub-agent reviewer 8 wire-format fixes), 096046e (earn-vault-svc Fastify scaffold + GET /users/:userId/vault + stub-aware reader), 834ced8 (earn-vault #61 batch-1 — squads multisig scaffold + solvency invariant + emergency_withdraw closing H-02 + H-04 + H-05), a410d86 (#50 paste-helper script), 075fbd1 (#63 wallet lint + transfer/ledger Prisma migrations), f461e88 (#63 user-service Prisma migrations). **Issue flips:** #58 closed (PARTIAL → PASS after fixes); #16 closed (scaffold complete; activation gated on #15 program); #61 in-progress (batch-1 of N — adapter CPIs + UserShare PDA remain toolchain-bound per runbook 584c169); #63 in-progress (CI build pending). **Workspace health:** 19/19 pnpm packages typecheck clean; 37+ vitest passing in offramp + 3 passing in earn-vault. **CI:** unblocked end-to-end via repo public flip + lint fixes; Build & Deploy on f461e88 running. **No workarounds rule (founder 2026-05-27):** all session work flows through GHA CI → ghcr.io → openova-private Flux. Mech-4 podman+ghcr is BANNED (saved as durable memory feedback_no_workarounds_ever.md).

**Prior refresh (2026-05-24):** FULL-stack mech-4 sweep + P23 5-mech audit + 6 DoD screenshots + Monitor-caught cebuana drift fix + locale-matrix contract test + per-Wave issue #59 retroactively filed. **All 10 ping services on bastion-built mech-4 images** (auth/wallet/fx/compliance/gamification/notify/token/web-claim → 55189e6; ledger/user/transfer/claim → 5793640; offramp → df1c0d9). Bastion podman + classic PAT push to ghcr bypasses #54 GHA billing block. Full 5-stage corridor walks PASS on the all-fresh stack: latest claimCode=g5xPbCaCc4C3 → PING-A368B1BB. Side-walks confirm wallet/balance hits real Solana mainnet RPC (258297.574098 USDC). TRUST: 64 🟢 / 3 🟡 / 11 🔴. **P23 5-mech audit on each parked**: #50 reclassified (direct ConfigMap path; founder-paste-only — 15 keys from provider dashboards); #15/#23/#24 confirmed founder-business gate (Cayman + audit per runbook 584c169); #62 toolchain-bound residuals documented.

## BACKLOG-STANDARDS.md audit — 2026-05-24

Per [dynolabs-io/workflow BACKLOG-STANDARDS.md](https://github.com/dynolabs-io/workflow/blob/main/docs/BACKLOG-STANDARDS.md). Triage decision tree applied to every open issue:

- **Action A (fix in place):** 7 issues — #1 EPIC, #22 EPIC, #7 EPIC, #15, #16, #23, #24, #36, #50 (reformatted title + 4-section body + correct labels)
- **Action B (close + re-file):** 0 — every open issue had clear intent
- **Action C (close as not-planned):** 0 — none obsolete

Issues left untouched (status/completed, awaiting founder close): #2-#6, #8-#14, #17-#21, #25-#35, #37, #39 — these conformed to per-Wave discipline at filing time; will reformat lazily IF re-opened.

Status counts post-audit: 1 in-progress (#36), 6 blocked-ext (#7, #15, #16, #23, #24, #50), 21 completed, 2 unclaimed EPIC parents (#1, #22).

## Current Sprint Focus

Phase 1 MVP — Philippines corridor. Goal: ship one end-to-end transfer (GCC sender → PH recipient → GCash cash-out) by Month 6.

## Real-cred plug-in (not blockers — stub-mode live)

The platform is fully walkable TODAY on stub-mode adapters. None of the rows below block the end-user DoD: walks #1 (GCash) + #2 (Maya) both passed end-to-end without these. Real creds are hot-swap via `ping-config` ConfigMap in the openova-private repo — code unchanged. (Note: target-state platform pattern is OpenBao + external-secrets; this Sovereign on Contabo predates that stack — direct ConfigMap is the current op path. See #50 audit comment 4526414922.)
